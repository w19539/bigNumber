# bigNumber
Big Number calculation without non-standard C++/C libraries

1. The code can be run both in Linux and Windows.
2. To run in Linux, firstly need to run "sudo apt-get install libboost-test-dev" to install boost test framework lib. Then run runBigPower.sh to run the application, or run runTest.sh for the simple test.
3. To run in Windows, currently, I used CLion with minGW and installed boost library for the development and test. The CMakeLists.txt file is attached.
